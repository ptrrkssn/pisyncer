# pisyncer
Web frontend to isync (mbsync)

Copyright (c) 2016 Peter Eriksson <pen@lysator.liu.se>

A simple CGI binary that makes it easier for users to initiate an IMAP sync between two mail servers.

Needs a lot of work - do not use as is, probably contains bugs and is very specific for the current
environment at IFM / LiU.
